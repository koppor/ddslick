! This fork does not work !

I'm currently at the old version and working around the issue that `onSelected` is also called when loading the widget.

In the long run, I'll switch to select2, which also supports images through its templating system.


ddSlick
Author: Prashant Chaudhary (http://designwithpc.com)
Plugin Demo & Documentation: http://designwithpc.com/Plugins/ddSlick

A free light weight jQuery plugin that allows you to create a custom drop down with images and description.

About this plugin:

Adds images and description to otherwise boring drop downs.
Allows JSON to populate the drop down options.
Converts your HTML select element to ddSlick.
Uses Minimum css and no external stylesheets to download.
Supports callback functions on selection.
Works as good even without images or description!

Why is this plugin useful:

With traditional drop downs i.e. using <select> <option> </option> </select> you are limited to only text and value. But with this easily configurable jquery plugin, you can now create a custom drop down that can very well include images, a short description, along with your usual text and value. Take a look at the following demos in action.
